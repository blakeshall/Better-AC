# Better AC

This is a Firefox Extension for improving Lexington KY's version of Agency Counter.
It changes all the record numbers into links that will open Accela in a new tab for
that record. Some types of building records don't work, but the majority do.

It also changes the button for "New Request" to "New Search" because "New Request"
is confusing and a poor choice of words.
