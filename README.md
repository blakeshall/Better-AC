# Better AC

This is a Firefox Extension for improving Lexington KY's version of Agency Counter.
It changes all the record numbers into links that will open Accela in a new tab for
that record. Some types of building records don't work, but the majority do.

It also changes the button for "New Request" to "New Search" because "New Request"
is confusing and a poor choice of words.

## Installation

To install just [click here](/better-ac.xpi?raw=true). This will download the .XPI (essentially a ZIP but with a different extension).
Open that file (you may have to select Open With FireFox) and you should have one last confirmation. With that, it should be good
and will start working on [lexingtonky.agencycounter.com](https://lexingtonky.agencycounter.com).

I believe this will also work for Chromium based browsers. I have to verify the manifest V3 stuff. But the installation instructions
will vary from browser to browser. Just search "browser_name install extension from file" or something like that.
